# Object-Tracking-and-Counting-in-a-Video
Project from scratch to track and count the number of objects moving in a scene presented in a video. This is based on Image processing and traditional computer vision techniques.
Two different methods are implemented.
Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, Density based Clustering, Convolutions, Numpy, Matplotlib.

# Method 1:
Using Density based clustering to count moving objects in a trafiic based video.
